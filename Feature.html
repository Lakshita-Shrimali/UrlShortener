    <h1>Benefits of using a URL shortener</h1>
    <hr>

    <h3>Aside from just being more pleasing to the eye, shortened URLs can have the following added benefits.</h3>
    <h2>More streamlined in appearance</h2>
    <h3>All URLs start out the same way, but after that initial similarity, they can go many different ways. If you’re trying to build a brand and are doing so through a social media campaign, having all your links be the same length and appear very similar is crucial. Shortened links look better in Instagram bios, as well as in Twitter bios. They provide a clean look to a page that can otherwise be overwhelmed with photos and other types of content.</h3>
    <h2>Easier to replicate</h2>
    <h3>This doesn’t happen much anymore, given the ability to copy and paste a link from pretty much any device. But if someone has chosen to share a URL by typing it out into a message, having to then type in 45 different numbers, letters, and characters isn’t efficient. There’s too much room for error, and a would-be sharer could end getting frustrated and quit before sharing your link with anyone.</h3>
    <h2>Tracking capabilities</h2>
    <h3>Another asset of using an online tool to shorten a link is that clicks on the link can be tracked. This is not only beneficial for your business as a whole but for whoever handles your social media management. When that person or team goes to put together reports, having the metrics for links is just as important as tracking likes, comments, follows, etc.</h3>
    <h2>More legitimacy</h2>
    <h3>A shortened link matching other links on your digital marketing materials and social media content lends legitimacy to you as a business. Long URLs with random characters and numbers can look shady, especially to someone who’s a new customer. If you’re aiming for high social media engagement, using shortened URLs might be just what you need.</h3>
